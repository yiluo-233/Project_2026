I want to write something about my life, thoughts, and opinions.

As English isn't my first language, I'm a bit rusty. I always know what I want to say, but I can't find the words, Ahh. But I will keep working on it so that one day  I can properly express what's on my mind. For now, I still have to rely on tools like Gemini or GPT.o(╥﹏╥)o
